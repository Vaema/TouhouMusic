Touhou Music Replacements is a mod that changes various vanilla boss music with Touhou (and some Touhou fan-game) music.
This mod is not done yet. There are some more music that I (Vaema) am planning on implementing.
Music boxes are probably going to be implemented soon.

Music Used:

ZUN:
- Gensokyo, Past and Present ~ Flower Land (Empress of Light)

Concealed the Conclusion (Fan-game):
- The Legend of KAGE (King Slime)
- Plastic Mind (Skeletron)
- Night Falls ~ Evening Star (Lunatic Cultist)
- G Free ~ Final Dream (Moon Lord, Phase 1)
- G Free ~ Ultimate Dream (Moon Lord, Phase 2)
